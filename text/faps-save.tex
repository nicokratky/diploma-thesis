In order to be able to look up recent sensor readouts, all data that is received from the sensor has to be saved in a persistent way. This chapter introduces the program that was implemented to solve this task.

\section{File Type}

% what is HDF5
% why was it chosen
% structure of a HDF5 file
% differences between HDF5 and HDF4

\section{Structure}

% each sensor readout has its own dataset
% datasets are identified by timestamp

\section {C++ Library}

% library from HDF Group is complex
% wrapper library for ease of use
% HighFive

\section{Implementation}

% don't interrupt sensor reading
% data has to be transmitted over network anyway
% also act as client to faps
% use faps-networking
