\chapter{Abstract}

This diploma thesis introduces GRAMOC, a system that can help to effectively characterise steel belts without halting the production lines. This is made possible by using a recently invented MEMS gradient magnetometer to measure the magnetic field of produced steel belts.

This new procedure not only increases productivity, but is also a lot more material and cost efficient.

GRAMOC consists of two command line programs and one web application. One command line program is the server that processes the data that is received from the sensor. This program also performs dynamic data analysis using this data. The second command line program handles data storage, as all sensor data has to be saved to HDF5 files to allow further inspection. These two programs run on a Raspberry Pi 3 Model B. The client program is a web application that visualises the received sensor data. It also provides a form to the users to request historical sensor data from the HDF5 files.

The received data is analysed using multiple linear regression. This analysis method allows to predict mechanical parameters of the steel belt from magnetic data that is received from the sensor.
