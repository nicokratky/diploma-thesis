% what are we trying to solve / what is the problem?
% why is it important?

% continuous quality inspection of steel belts
% current solution:
%   produce a certain amount
%   take sample
%   use sample to perform quality checks (stretch tests, ...)
% waste of material / low yield
% time consuming
% not automatable

% perform quality checks with sensors
% mechanical parameters can be calculated from magnetic field data
% highly sensitive MEMS gradient magnetometer
% try to predict faulty material in real time

% minimize faulty material
% change contact pressure of steel belt rolls if something's going wrong
% cost reduction
% automatization (IoT, Industry 4.0)

% CURRENT SOLUTIONS

% real time plotting
% a lot of solutions exist
% little solutions transfer data over network, many assume that sensor is attached to computer
% also no big data volume

% OUTLINE
% short summary of thesis
% explain two phases (I & II)
%   first phase => experimental, learning by doing
%   second phase => 'we know what we were doing', better planned
