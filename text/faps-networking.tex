FaPS Networking is a custom UDP-based library that is mainly used for communication between FaPS (see \ref{ch:faps}) and different kinds of client, eg. FaPS-save (see \ref{ch:faps-save}) and the NodeJS server (see
\ref{sec:webserver}).

\section{TCP vs UDP in real time environments}

% comparison between TCP Header and UDP Header -> more Overhead -> more Information
% TCP -> feedback mechanism, not relevant in real time environments, when dropped packets are resent they are outdated and not relevant -> don't care when dropped
% TCP is perfect for transferring big files bc when one byte is missing whole file is corrupt
% reliability comes at cost -> much larger overhead!
%
% include images of headers!!!!

\todo{cite whole paragraph like this?}

\section {Handling Connections}

% UDP is connectionless!
% Server does not even know if the other end exists
% way of connection-handling had to be implemented
% keepalive packets
% sent every second

% server manages a list of 'connected clients'
% if client misses the timeframe of 1 second -> remove from list

% server messages are almost always multicasted (-> sent to all clients) (exception: control messages)

% include image of keepalive messages

\section {Handshake}

% include image of TCP-like three way handshake
