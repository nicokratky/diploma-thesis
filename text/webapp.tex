After the conclusion that an Android application would not satisfy all the requirements of GRAMOC, the decision to build a Web application was made. A so called ``Webapp'' is an application that runs inside a web browser (e.g. Google Chrome) and is usually provided by a web server. After a user connects to the web server, the user will get application files and data, this enables the ability of a Webapp to be platform independent.

\section{Framework}
To create a modern Webapp a developer should choose a framework to build this web application. A software framework can be classified as a huge software library, it provides basic functionality like rendering content or routing between views in the context of a web framework. The biggest benefit of a web framework is that the developer does not have to reinvent the wheel, because a framework already implements the basic functionalities, also the majority of frameworks out there are open source, which means thousands of people can help to enhance the project and also resolve issues. Therefore the user gains a solid code base which is efficient, secure and usually well documented.

\subsection{Vue.js}
In the case of GRAMOC, a framework called ``Vue.js'' was used because of the performance compared to other big frameworks and the ``simplicity and ease of use'', as stated in a blog post published by the Frontend DC Lead of GitLab \cite{Vue} \cite{WhyVue} \cite{GitLab}. The performance was measured with the benchmark application from Stefan Krause, the results are partitioned in keyed and non keyed implementations \cite{FrameworkBenchmark}. The distinct each other in the way the data items are bind to the DOM (Document Object Model) node. The keyed implementation assigns a key to each node and the non keyed just updates the data inside of that particular node, therefore the non keyed implementation can achieve a higher performance since costly DOM operations like constantly removing and adding nodes can be avoided.

Following table shows the average time in milliseconds each operation takes:

In order to use Vue.js it is recommended by the developers to use ``webpack''  as module bundler and ``Babel'' as JavaScript compiler \cite{webpack} \cite{Babel}.

\subsubsection{webpack}
webpack is a module bundler for modern JavaScript applications, that builds a dependency graph which includes every module needed to run the application. It packages all the needed modules into several bundles which will be commonly served as static asserts.

\subsubsection{Babel}
Babel is a JavaScript compiler that is capable of converting up to date JavaScript code into correct JavaScript code of a prior version. This is especially useful when a developer needs to work in an environment where the most recent version of JavaScript is not supported, but still wants to be able to write up to date JavaScript code.

\section{Web Server}
\label{sec:webserver}
To make a web application accessible to a user, there needs to be a web server which serves the files to the web browser of the user. In the case of GRAMOC, ``Node.js'' with its built-in module HTTP was chosen to be used as a web server \cite{Node}.

A web server is a server dedicated to provide information, web sites or web applications. To achieve that goal the web server transmits first the files needed to run the web application and then sends information whenever they are requested. In this project, ``Node.js'' with its built-in module HTTP was selected to be utilized as a web server \cite{Node}.

\subsection{Node.js}
Node.js is an asynchronous event driven JavaScript runtime, designed to build network applications \cite{Node}. The built-in HTTP module can be used to create a web server based on Node. This module can either communicate over the HTTP protocol or establish an IPC connection. In terms of GRAMOC, this is utterly useful because the sensor data needs to be received over an IPC connection and then transmitted over HTTP to the web application. Therefore the primary function of the Node server is to receive data which is emitted by the Filtering and Preprocessing Layer (FAPS) and forward it, to the web application via web sockets implemented through the ``socket.io'' library \cite{socketio}. The Webapp itself is served by ``Express'' \cite{express}.

\subsection{socket.io}
socket.io is a JavsScript library that implements real-time communication via web sockets. This library was chosen because it aims to make real-time applications possible in every browser and can be used in a Node.js application. Since GRAMOC was built with the intent of delivering sensor data in real-time to the user, socket.io helped a lot in the step of implementing real-time communication.

\subsection{Express}
Express is a minimal and flexible web application framework to be used with Node.js. It is based on the HTTP module, which is a part of the standard library of Node.js and its main focus is to manage the routing tasks associated with the running HTTP server. So Express is just a layer on top of a web server, but not a web server itself.

\section{Plotly}
To visualize the data received from the sensor a graphing library called ``Plotly'', more specific the open source JavaScript library ``plotly.js'' \cite{Plotly} \cite{PlotlyJS}. Plotly is build on top of state of the art JavaScript libraries like ``d3.js''  and ``stackgl'' \cite{d3} \cite{stackgl}. The library offers a broad variety of two and three dimensional charts in the categories statistical, financial, scientific and more. In GRAMOC the chosen graphing library is Plotly, because of the capability to easily create custom, dynamic and real time charts.

\section{Workflow}

As shown in figure \ref{fig:webserver-program-flow} the server asynchronously tries to connect with the IPC socket and starts listening for incoming connections on a specified port. The server keeps retrying to connect to the IPC socket until a connection is established because without this connection no data can be forwarded to the web application. If a client connects on the before specified port the connection will be immediately upgraded to a socket connection and the web application will be served to the user. When the Webapp launches it will display the Home page, then the user can navigate to the 2D, the 3D or the About page, through the navigation bar at the top. If the About page was selected the user simply gets a static about page. If the user navigates to the 2D page, three line charts will be initialized and the client emits a message to the server to start receive the sensor data. This data will be used to update the charts accordingly.
